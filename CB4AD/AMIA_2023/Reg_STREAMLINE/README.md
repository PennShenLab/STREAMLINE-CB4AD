## Abstract
STREAMLINE is a simple, transparent, end-to-end automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline for 
easily conducting rigorous machine learning (ML) modeling and analysis. The initial version is 
limited to binary classification. To expand its functionality and versatility, in this work, 
we extend STREAMLINE through implementing multiple regression-based ML models, including linear 
regression, elastic net, random forest, support vector regressor, group lasso, L21 norm regularized 
linear regression, Adaptive Boosting, and Gradient Boosting. 
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the regression version of STREAMLINE by applying it to 
the prediction of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) cognitive outcomes using multimodal brain imaging 
data. Our empirical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the newly expanded 
STREAMLINE as an AutoML pipeline for evaluating AD regression models, and for discovering multimodal 
imaging biomarkers.
